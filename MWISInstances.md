This collection contains interesting instances of the maximum weighted independent set  (MWIS) problem as they arise in graph coloring by column generation. They can be used as benchmarks for maximum weighted independent set or clique problems.

Of particular interest are the instances:

- DSJC500.1.mwis.117.dimacs and DSJC1000.1.mwis.3915.dimacs, which currently cannot be  solved within a few weeks.

- C2000.5.mwis.1029.dimacs, where a faster exact MWIS solver would allow for computing
> a tight approximation of the fractional coloring number.
